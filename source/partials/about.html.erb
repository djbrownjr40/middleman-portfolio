            <br>
             I grew up in a flyover state of the American Midwest. I spent a summer in Dresden, Germany during university, traveled around Europe a bit, then moved to Japan after graduating, where I now reside. </p>

          <p class="noto-serif">Recently I had an opportunity to study at a coding bootcamp with <i>Le Wagon</i> in Tokyo. I learned the foundations of languages like Ruby and JavaScript and had a blast building a few nice apps from start to finish.</p>
